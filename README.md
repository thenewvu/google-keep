## Installation

1. Clone or download (then decompress) this repo
2. Open Chrome/Settings/Extensions, turn on `Developer mode`, press `Load unpacked extension...` and pick the directory where the repo was cloned (decompressed) to.
3. Open a new tab, press "Apps" on the bookmark bar and finally open `Google Keep`.

## Usage

* Press `Ctrl` to toggle the toolbar.
* On the toolbar, there's a draggable area, you can reposition the app by dragging it.
* On Linux, the draggable area might not work with your window manager, bspwm in my case, use the way that the window manager provides to you.

## Legal
