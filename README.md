## The problem I have

I need a note-taking app that meets below requirements:

* Support platforms: Mac, Arch Linux, Android, iOS
* Support "Always on top" on desktop platforms
* Support cloud synchronization
* Minimal text formatting

## The solution I made

Google Keep matches almost all above requirements except "Always on top", the little but essential one. So I give some spare time to do it by myself, this app is the result.

It hides all unnecessary parts of Google Keep that personally I don't need them in daily work, such as the banner and the scrollbar. It also has the default font face is "Operator Mono", a premium font that makes me feel good.
